I have served as a graduate student instructor (GSI) at Berkeley for Econ 133 (Global Inequality and Growth - taught by Gabriel Zucman) in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020, and for Econ 140 (Economic Statistics and Econometrics - taught by Evgeniya Duzhak) in Fall 2018. <br/>
I received the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) award, which is given to the top 10% of GSIs, in 2020.  <br/>
You can find the syllabus and class content for Econ 133 [here](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/econ133-2019/). <br/>
